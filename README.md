## File Operations in Java

This Java program simulates basic file operations such as reading, writing, and modifying a file using a String variable instead of an actual file. It allows users to enter content, store it, modify it by appending additional text, and read the updated content. The program uses the Scanner class to take user input and provides a simple yet effective way to demonstrate file-handling concepts without involving actual disk operations.

The program consists of three primary methods: writeFile(), which stores user input as file content; readFile(), which displays the stored content; and modifyFile(), which appends additional user input to the existing content. The main() method orchestrates these operations by first prompting the user to enter initial content, writing it to the simulated file, displaying the content, allowing modifications, and then reading the updated content again.

The tools used in this project include the Java Development Kit (JDK) for compiling and running the code, the Scanner class for user input handling, and an IDE such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, or NetBeans for development, though the program can also be executed using a terminal with the javac and java commands.

To run the program, save the file as FileOperations.java, open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the file, and compile it using javac FileOperations.java. Then, run the program using java FileOperations, follow the on-screen prompts, and observe how the file content is updated dynamically.
